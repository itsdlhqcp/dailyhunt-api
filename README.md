    content: "Washington [US], June 9 (ANI): US Senate on Tuesday passed bipartisan legislation aimed at countering China's growing influence by investing over USD 200 billion in American technology, science and research. The final vote was 68-32. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was the only member of the Democratic caucus to vote against the bill. Nineteen Senate Republicans joined Democrats voting in favour of the bill, CNN reported. The bill still needs to pass the House before going to President Joe Biden's desk. The sweeping legislation -- called the US Innovation and Competition Act -- aims to confront China 's influence on multiple fronts and "will supercharge American innovation and preserve our competitive edge for generations to come," said Majority Leader Chuck Schumer who co-wrote the bill. Schumer described the vote as a necessary step to keep America in the game against countries such as China , and a significant legislative accomplishment after months of behind-the-scenes talks.",
